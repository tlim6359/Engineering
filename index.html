    <h3>Week 1, 9/2/22, We went over the syllabus and how the engineering class will work.</h3>
    <hr><h3>Week 2, 9/9/22, We worked on our project and our second challenge. <br>The project was making a machine to pop the baloon. We will be using different mechanisms including a pulley, lever, and a wheel and axle.Second challenge was to create a 3D object in TikerCAD that looks like the object in real life. I made a computer mouse, and it was pretty challenging to make the curves.</br></h3></hr>

  <h3>Week 3, 9/15/22, Our group completed modeling our Goldberg in TinkerCAD. We chose one design that we thought would work the best, and that was Connor's. There was no time to waste, so we got to building. It went pretty well, but we had to make some adjustments on some dimensions and designs. So far, we have completed making the inclined plane and we are working on the pulley and lever. I am proud of my team mates.</h3>
  <h4>This is my design, and this is Connor's.</h4>
